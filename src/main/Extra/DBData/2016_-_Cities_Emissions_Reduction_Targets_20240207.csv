Subsequent to the completion of the 2007 GHG emissions inventory, the City established the following emissions reduction targets: 

Short-term: 
Reduction of 20% below 2007 levels by 2020 
*Equals 1.5% annual reduction until 2020 

Long-term: 
Reduction of 80% below 2007 levels by 2050 
*Equals 2% annual reduction between 2020 and 2050 

To achieve its 2020 goal, the City would have to reduce the emissions generated by its municipal operations by 4,657 tons of CO2 equivalent, while the community-wide emissions reduction would have to approach 86,485 tons of CO2 equivalent. These are not insignificant numbers, but if the City and community come together in working towards those same goals, we can surely achieve them.

This makes New York the largest city to commit to the 80 percent reduction by 2050, and charts a long-term path for investment in renewable sources of energy and a total transition from fossil fuels.

Nearly three quarters of New York City’s greenhouse gas emissions come from energy used to heat, cool, and power buildings, making building retrofits a central component of any plan to dramatically reduce emissions.

The City is poised to make direct investments to increase the efficiency of its public buildings, including schools and public housing, reducing the government’s contribution to climate change and generating operational savings for New York City taxpayers. Every single city-owned building with any significant energy use – approximately 3,000 buildings – will be retrofitted within the next ten years, by 2025, with interim goals along the way.","(40.7127837, -74.0059413)"
